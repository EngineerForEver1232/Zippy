## Zippy


This service is provided to help car owners who are suddenly stuck on the road and their car breaks down. This allows inspectors to diagnose the car on the spot and, if necessary, make the necessary repairs. These services usually include moving the vehicle to the nearest workshop or repair shop, general or emergency repairs and providing technical guidance to face possible problems in areas such as heating and air conditioning, engine, battery, etc. These services are usually provided by organizations such as emergency driving services or insurance companies.
